    <h1>Understanding the Levels of Full-Stack Development</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A Full-Stack Developer is a versatile professional capable of handling both front-end and back-end development tasks. Their expertise spans multiple layers of the technology stack, enabling them to build comprehensive and efficient applications. This white paper outlines the four levels of full-stack development, each representing an increasing depth and breadth of skills and responsibilities.</p>
        <p>There is deliberately no specific mention of ability along the horizontal axis. This document serves as an objective guide for the areas in which capabilities should be expected to exist, rather than assessing the efficacy of each individual within each capability.</p>

    <section class="level">
        <h2>Level 1: Basic Full-Stack Development</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This level involves using a JavaScript or TypeScript framework for both front-end and back-end development. The backend is built using a JavaScript/TypeScript-based language, facilitating seamless integration between client and server.</p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul class="advantages">
            <li>Unified language across the stack, simplifying development and maintenance.</li>
            <li>Faster development cycles due to the use of a single language for both front-end and back-end.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="level">
        <h2>Level 2: Intermediate Full-Stack Development</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This level combines a front-end framework with <strong>any</strong> backend language and <strong>potentially</strong> an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. It enhances database interactions and simplifies data management through the use of ORM or othe database abstraction.</p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul class="advantages">
            <li>Improved efficiency in database operations, reducing the need for manual SQL queries.</li>
            <li>Enhanced scalability and maintainability of the application through structured ORM usage.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="level">
        <h2>Level 3: Advanced Full-Stack Development</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This level employs vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with a front-end framework. It utilizes multiple backend languages with a comprehensive understanding of databases, enabling the execution of manual SQL queries without relying on an ORM.</p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul class="advantages">
            <li>Greater control over front-end and back-end interactions without the abstraction layer of an ORM.</li>
            <li>Enhanced performance optimization through direct and manual database management.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="level">
        <h2>Level 4: Expert Full-Stack Development</h2>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This advanced level builds upon Level 3 by integrating cloud services and infrastructure automation tools such as Terraform or Docker. It encompasses comprehensive cloud infrastructure management, enabling the deployment of scalable and resilient solutions tailored to project requirements.</p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul class="advantages">
            <li>Scalable and resilient application deployments in cloud environments.</li>
            <li>Streamlined infrastructure management and deployment processes through automation tools.</li>
            <li>Enhanced reliability and performance of applications through robust cloud services integration.</li>
            <li>Ability to manage complex infrastructures, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding the different levels of full-stack development allows organizations and developers to identify the appropriate skill sets required for various project complexities. From basic integration of front-end and back-end frameworks to expert-level cloud services and infrastructure management, each level builds upon the previous one, enhancing the ability to deliver robust and efficient software solutions.</p>
